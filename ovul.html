You can also add fresh herbs like parsley, cilantro, or basil to enhance the taste. For the dressing, mix olive oil with balsamic vinegar or lemon juice, a touch of honey or maple syrup for sweetness, and season with salt, pepper, and optional mustard or garlic powder for extra flavor.

            <h3>6. Green Teà</h3>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <p>To prepare a simple and refreshing cup of green tea, you’ll need green tea leaves or a green tea bag. Start by heating water to just below boiling, around 170-180°F (77-82°C), as water that’s too hot can make the tea taste bitter. Pour the hot water over the tea leaves or tea bag in a cup or teapot. Let it steep for about 2-3 minutes, allowing the leaves to release their delicate flavor. If desired, you can add a small amount of honey or lemon to enhance the taste. For extra freshness, a few fresh mint leaves can also be added. Stir gently and enjoy the soothing and healthy benefits of this aromatic beverage.</p><br>
