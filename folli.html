            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <p>To make a delicious Tofu Stir Fry with Veggies, start with firm tofu, pressed to remove excess moisture and cut into cubes.

For the sauce, combine soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, a touch of honey or maple syrup, and a sprinkle of chili flakes for heat. Return the tofu to the pan, pour the sauce over everything, and toss to coat. Garnish with sesame seeds or fresh cilantro, and serve the stir fry over rice or noodles for a complete, healthy meal.</p><br>

            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <p>To make a simple and nutritious Chia Pudding, start with chia seeds, typically about 3 tablespoons per serving.
