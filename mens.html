            <h3>2. Beef Or Chicken Stir Fry</h3>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <p>To make a Beef or Chicken Stir Fry, start with your choice of protein—either thinly sliced beef (like flank steak or sirloin) or chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces. For the vegetables, you can use a mix of bell peppers, onions, carrots, broccoli, and snap peas, all sliced into similar-sized pieces for even cooking. In a wok or large pan, heat some oil (vegetable or sesame oil works well) and quickly stir-fry the protein until it’s browned and cooked through. Remove the protein from the pan and set it aside. In the same pan, sauté garlic and ginger until fragrant, then add the vegetables and stir-fry until they are tender-crisp. For the sauce, mix together soy sauce, a bit of honey or brown sugar, rice vinegar, and a dash of sesame oil, along with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for heat. Return the protein to the pan, pour the sauce over everything, and toss to coat. Serve the stir fry over steamed rice or noodles for a complete and satisfying meal.</p><br>

            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <p>To make a flavorful Spinach Stew, start with fresh spinach, washed and roughly chopped. For the base, sauté onions, garlic, and ginger in a bit of olive oil or butter until softened and aromatic. Add diced tomatoes and cook them down until they break apart and become saucy. Season with spices like cumin, turmeric, coriander, and a pinch of chili flakes for heat. You can also add a bit of vegetable broth or water to create the desired consistency for the stew. To enrich the flavor, add coconut milk or a splash of cream for a creamy texture. Once the base is ready, stir in the chopped spinach and let it cook down until wilted. For extra protein, you can include lentils or beans, and season with salt and black pepper to taste. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve the stew with rice or bread for a wholesome, comforting meal.</p><br>

            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <p>To make a delicious Banana Smoothie with Almond Butter, start with a ripe banana, peeled and sliced, as the base for natural sweetness and creaminess.

            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
