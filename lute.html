            <h3>3. Dark Chocolate with Almonds</h3>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <p>To make Dark Chocolate with Almonds, start with high-quality dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa) as the base, which provides a rich, bittersweet flavor. Gently melt the chocolate, either using a double boiler or in short bursts in the microwave, stirring in between to prevent burning. Once melted, fold in roasted almonds, which should be roughly chopped or left whole, depending on your preference. You can add a pinch of sea salt for contrast and enhance the flavor. For an extra touch, a splash of vanilla extract can be stirred into the chocolate for depth. Pour the mixture onto a parchment-lined baking sheet or into a silicone mold and let it cool completely at room temperature or in the refrigerator until it hardens. This combination of dark chocolate and almonds creates a delicious, crunchy, and slightly salty treat.</p><br>
